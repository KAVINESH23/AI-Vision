# AI-Vision

## Purpose

This project detects **Emergency Lighting Fixtures** from construction blueprints (PDFs) using **computer vision and OCR**, then groups them into structured outputs for downstream use with LLMs.

It solves the real-world challenge of extracting meaningful data from unstructured electrical drawings â€” a key step in automating building inspection, compliance, and facility management.
